Hi!  I'm Tanner, the guy who runs this (eponymous) URL.

This site is the online home of my many creative endeavors.  Some have been successful, others have not, but everything here represents a labor of love.  As long as these projects continue to receive traffic, I'll happily make them available under the most liberal terms I can (currently [a CC-BY license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) for audio samples, [a simplified BSD license](http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php) for code, and [a CC-BY-SA license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) for everything else).

If you have comments or questions about anything you've found here, please [get in touch](contact).

Kind regards,

Tanner

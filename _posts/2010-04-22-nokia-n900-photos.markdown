excerpt: Now that Utah weather is FINALLY improving, my wife and I were finally able
  to take a road trip out to Red Butte Garden.  All photos here were taken with my
  Nokia N900. The phone has a 5mp sensor, but these were all taken at the 3.5mp setting
  (widescreen).  Not bad for a phone, eh?

Now that Utah weather is FINALLY improving, my wife and I were finally able to take a road trip out to [Red Butte Garden](http://www.redbuttegarden.org/).Â  All photos here were taken with my [Nokia N900](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N900).  The phone has a 5mp sensor, but these were all taken at the 3.5mp setting (widescreen).

Not bad for a phone, eh?

Thank you to the Mandriva team for naming one of my photos a winner in their "community background contest."  For those interested, the following photo will be available as a background in the mandriva-theme-extra package of Mandriva 2010.2:

I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to one of the best Linux distros (even if it's in an inconsequential way).

I strongly recommend checking out the other contest winners at [the official Mandriva blog](http://blog.mandriva.com/2010/12/21/community-backgrounds-contest-winners/). [OStatic also provides a list of the photos](http://ostatic.com/blog/mandriva-wallpaper-contest-winners-chosen), with commentary.

If you haven't tried Mandriva, you're missing out.  Give it a whirl at [openmandriva.org](https://www.openmandriva.org/).

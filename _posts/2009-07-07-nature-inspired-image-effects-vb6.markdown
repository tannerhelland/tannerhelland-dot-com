Today's article brings a collection of random image effects that can be quickly (and programmatically) generated.  In an attempt to give the project some coherency, I've named each effect after something "nature-themed" to help distinguish them.

Below, you can see how each filter looks on a promotional image from [_Final Fantasy Versus XIII_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Versus_XIII).

**[Download the sample app and source code from GitHub](https://github.com/tannerhelland/vb6-code/tree/master/Nature-effects)**

For more advanced nature-related effects, you can explore [the source code of any tools in the Effects > Nature menu](https://github.com/tannerhelland/PhotoDemon/tree/master/Forms) of my open-source photo editor, [PhotoDemon](https://photodemon.org).  These filters are much more advanced, with multiple user-controllable settings.

For example, here's a screenshot of PhotoDemon's Effects > Nature > Fog tool, which uses [Simplex Noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_noise) to produce its real-time fog effect:
